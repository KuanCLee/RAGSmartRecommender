# RAG Product Recommendation

This repository aims to build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed to recommend products based on their descriptions. The system leverages powerful embedding models and vector search to find the most relevant products tailored to user queries.

As a prototype, this project uses publicly available product data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karkavelrajaj/amazon-sales-dataset?select=amazon.csv) to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach.


## Technologies Used

- Python  
- OpenAI embeddings  
- Chroma (vector database)  
- Pandas for data handling
